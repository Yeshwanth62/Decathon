# Sanjeevani 2.0 Monitoring and Observability Guide

This guide provides information on monitoring and observability for Sanjeevani 2.0.

## Overview

Sanjeevani 2.0 uses the following tools for monitoring and observability:

- **Sentry** - Error tracking and monitoring
- **Google Analytics** - User behavior tracking
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring** - Performance tracking
- **Logging** - Application logs
- **Health Checks** - API health monitoring

## Sentry

Sentry is used for error tracking and monitoring in both the frontend and backend.

### Frontend

The frontend uses Sentry to track errors and exceptions in the React application. Sentry is initialized in `src/utils/sentry.js` and integrated with the application in `src/index.js`.

Key features:
- Error boundaries for React components
- User context tracking
- Custom error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### Backend

The backend uses Sentry to track errors and exceptions in the FastAPI application. Sentry is initialized in `app/main.py` and integrated with the application using middleware.

Key features:
- Request ID tracking
- Exception handling
- Performance monitoring
- Context tracking

### Sentry Dashboard

To access the Sentry dashboard:

1. Go to [Sentry](https://sentry.io)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Select the Sanjeevani 2.0 project
4. View errors, performance metrics, and other data

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is used to track user behavior in the frontend application. It is initialized in `public/index.html` and integrated with the application in `src/utils/analytics.js`.

Key features:
- Page view tracking
- Event tracking
- User tracking
- Custom dimensions and metrics

### Google Analytics Dashboard

To access the Google Analytics dashboard:

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Select the Sanjeevani 2.0 property
4. View reports, real-time data, and other metrics

## Firebase Performance Monitoring

Firebase Performance Monitoring is used to track performance metrics in the frontend application. It is initialized in `src/utils/firebase.js` and integrated with the application.

Key features:
- Page load time tracking
- API latency tracking
- Resource usage tracking
- Custom traces

### Firebase Performance Dashboard

To access the Firebase Performance dashboard:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Select the Sanjeevani 2.0 project
4. Go to Performance Monitoring
5. View performance metrics and traces

## Logging

Logging is implemented in both the frontend and backend applications.

### Frontend

The frontend uses console logging for development and Sentry for production. Key log points include:
- Authentication events
- API requests and responses
- Error conditions
- User actions

### Backend

The backend uses Python's logging module for structured logging. Key log points include:
- Request handling
- Database operations
- Authentication events
- Error conditions

Logs are sent to:
- Console (development)
- Sentry (production)
- Log files (production)

## Health Checks

Health checks are implemented in the backend API to monitor the health of the application and its dependencies.

### API Health Check

The backend API provides a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns the status of the application and its dependencies.

Example response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "database": "connected",
    "firebase": "connected",
    "twilio": "connected"
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Health Checks

You can use the following tools to monitor health checks:
- **Uptime Robot** - Free uptime monitoring
- **Pingdom** - Professional uptime monitoring
- **StatusCake** - Comprehensive monitoring solution

## Alerts

Alerts are configured to notify the team of critical issues.

### Sentry Alerts

Sentry is configured to send alerts for:
- New errors
- Error frequency thresholds
- Performance degradation

### Uptime Alerts

Uptime monitoring tools are configured to send alerts for:
- API downtime
- Frontend downtime
- Slow response times

### Custom Alerts

Custom alerts can be configured for:
- Database issues
- Authentication failures
- API rate limiting
- Security incidents

## Dashboards

Custom dashboards are available for monitoring the application:

### Sentry Dashboard

The Sentry dashboard provides:
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Release tracking
- User impact analysis

### Google Analytics Dashboard

The Google Analytics dashboard provides:
- User behavior tracking
- Conversion tracking
- Audience analysis
- Real-time monitoring

### Firebase Dashboard

The Firebase dashboard provides:
- Performance monitoring
- Crash reporting
- User engagement
- App distribution

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices for effective monitoring:

1. **Regular Review** - Review monitoring data regularly
2. **Alert Tuning** - Adjust alert thresholds to reduce noise
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Investigate issues thoroughly
4. **Documentation** - Document incidents and resolutions
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Use monitoring data to improve the application
